# Unlocking Fastboot Access on Oppo Mediatek to Unlock the Bootloader
The script in this repository is designed to create a modified preloader based on the factory one, in which the fastboot lock flag is changed to unlocked.


---
To use this script, you need to use [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) to read the preloader (boot1) dump from the device and place it in the same folder as preloader_path.py
