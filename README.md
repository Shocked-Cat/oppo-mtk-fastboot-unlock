# Unlocking Fastboot on Oppo Mediatek to Unlock Bootloader
The script in this repository is designed to create a modified preloader based on the factory one, in which the fastboot lock flag is changed to unlocked.

---
# To use this script, you need to:
* Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) 3.4+ version 
* Use [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient) to read the preloader (boot1) dump from you Oppo
* Place the preloader backup in the same folder as preloader_path.py, making sure to name it boot1.bin
* Then double-click on the Python script.
